## My Tutor Totoro

Letâ€™s be honest here: are you procrastinating on an assignment right now? As students, we understand the appeal of putting off an assignment for weeks and then pulling an all-nighter the day before itâ€™s due. I mean, hey, youâ€™re here right now, so surely itâ€™s fine to keep doing it? But, unfortunately, thatâ€™s not a sustainable way to live (trust us, we know ðŸ˜”). 

This adorable, Studio Ghibli and Tamagotchi-inspired (please donâ€™t sue us T-T), productivity application is here to help! Choose a pet that will keep you company while youâ€™re locked inðŸ’ª. With the GenAI-implemented chatbot, you can even ask it homework questions! Your pet will keep you accountable. Whenever you fail to accomplish a task in the set timeframe, your pet will lose health until it eventually falls into depression. To keep it happy, you must complete your tasks and stay on track. You wouldnâ€™t want it to be sad would you? 

We were inspired by our own struggles with chronic procrastination to create this application.

## What it does
This application helps keep you accountable. The AI chatbot can help answer any homework questions you might have.

## How we built it
We used React Native and Typescript to build the application.
